# Lab 3: Material Design

Include a Material Design library to make your application look a bit more user-friendly. [Lots of libraries to choose from](https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor#libraries--extensions):
* MatBlazor
* MudBlazor
* Blazorise
* Ant Design Blazor

Don't forget to remove the existing styling (Bootstrap and custom CSS).

A few Material Design components that can be used:

* `Card`s for displaying photos/photo details
* An `AppBar` for displaying the header
* A `Drawer` for displaying the navigation items
* `Button`s for... buttons
